# Document AI & RAG System (Demo)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates an applied AI system for document understanding and retrieval.
It combines OCR, document parsing, classification, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
using LlamaIndex and open-source / local LLMs.

## Problem
Manual document review and information retrieval are slow, error-prone, and hard to scale.

## Solution
An end-to-end AI pipeline that:
- Ingests PDFs (including scanned documents)
- Extracts and structures text
- Indexes documents for hybrid retrieval
- Uses RAG to answer queries accurately

## AI Components
- OCR & document parsing
- NLP & text chunking
- Vector indexing & hybrid search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Open-source / local LLMs

## Notes
This is a demonstration inspired by externship work.
No proprietary data, code, or workflows are included.
